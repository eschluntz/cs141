Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          162
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            99 out of     162   61%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of     162    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          63 out of     162   38%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              28 out of  54,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   3
Number of warnings :   0

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Place:1205 - This design contains a global buffer instance,
   <CLOCK_GEN/clkout1_buf>, driving the net, <cclk_OBUF>, that is driving the
   following (first 30) non-clock load pins off chip.
   < PIN: cclk.O; >
   This design practice, in Spartan-6, can lead to an unroutable situation due
   to limitations in the global routing. If the design does route there may be
   excessive delay or skew on this net. It is recommended to use a Clock
   Forwarding technique to create a reliable and repeatable low skew solution:
   instantiate an ODDR2 component; tie the .D0 pin to Logic1; tie the .D1 pin to
   Logic0; tie the clock net to be forwarded to .C0; tie the inverted clock to
   .C1. If you wish to override this recommendation, you may use the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint (given below) in the .ucf file to demote
   this message to a WARNING and allow your design to continue. Although the net
   may still not route, you will be able to analyze the failure in FPGA_Editor.
   < PIN "CLOCK_GEN/clkout1_buf.O" CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE; >

ERROR:Place:1136 - This design contains a global buffer instance,
   <CLOCK_GEN/clkout1_buf>, driving the net, <cclk_OBUF>, that is driving the
   following (first 30) non-clock load pins.
   < PIN: cclk.O; >
   This is not a recommended design practice in Spartan-6 due to limitations in
   the global routing that may cause excessive delay, skew or unroutable
   situations.  It is recommended to only use a BUFG resource to drive clock
   loads. If you wish to override this recommendation, you may use the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint (given below) in the .ucf file to demote
   this message to a WARNING and allow your design to continue.
   < PIN "CLOCK_GEN/clkout1_buf.O" CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE; >

ERROR:Pack:1654 - The timing-driven placement phase encountered an error.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Security:42 - Your software subscription period has lapsed. Your current
version of Xilinx tools will continue to function, but you no longer qualify for
Xilinx software updates or new releases.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Map:284 - Map is running with the multi-threading option on. Map currently
   supports the use of up to 2 processors. Based on the the user options and
   machine load, Map will use 2 processors during this run.
INFO:Security:54 - 'xc6slx45' is a WebPack part.
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network button_up_IBUF has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 5 more times for the following
   (max. 5 shown):
   button_down_IBUF,
   button_right_IBUF,
   button_left_IBUF,
   button_center_IBUF,
   touch_busy_IBUF
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to
   1.260 Volts)
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
INFO:Place:834 - Only a subset of IOs are locked. Out of 66 IOs, 65 are locked
   and 1 are not locked. If you would like to print the names of these IOs,
   please set the environment variable XIL_PAR_DESIGN_CHECK_VERBOSE to 1. 

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   1 block(s) removed
   2 block(s) optimized away
   1 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Loadless block "CLOCK_GEN/clkout2_buf" (CKBUF) removed.
 The signal "CLOCK_GEN/clkout1" is loadless and has been removed.

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
GND 		XST_GND
VCC 		XST_VCC

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
detailed map report option and rerun map.
